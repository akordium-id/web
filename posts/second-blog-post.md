# Exploring Markdown Features

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In this post, we'll explore some of the most useful markdown features.

## Basic Formatting

You can use **bold text** or _italic text_ to emphasize important points. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ when needed.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

### Ordered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

You can include inline code like `const greeting = "Hello, world!"` or code blocks:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Reader"));
```
